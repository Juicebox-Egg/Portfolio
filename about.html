            <a> What is this website about you may ask? Well I, Justin W will tell you what year 11 DT2 does based on my experience here in 2024.<br>
                Based on my experience here, in year 11 we learn various things such as coding using python and html-css along with creating a web-design using figma.<br>
                If you find yourself new here, then it may sound rather difficult to do things such as coding an entire website and yes I agree with that statement
                ,but although it may be hard to understand, the entire thing itself is rather really enjoyable and fun no matter what!<br>
                I find myself having so much fun here that it allows me to forget about all the stress I have when im trying to understand something.
                A reason why I would find it rather fun or interesting when I don't understand something is because when im either searching or asking the teacher
                the answer to my question, I find myself using the answer to my question that I just asked so much. In short,
                the more information you gather/knowabout coding, the more variety and interesting things you can do with yourself, that being creating a website or more.<br>
                Apologies for all the talking but in short the website I made is for people get a glimpse of what year 11 DT2 is really about and how this
                could be really interesting for you.
