            <a>If your on this page then it means you wondering to yourself "what is python?", well let me answer
                that question for you really quickly.<br>
                Python is a computer programming language that helps people build softwares, websites, automatic tasks and 
                data analysis. Basically its a special language when it comes to coding and in 11DT2, we would learn the basics
